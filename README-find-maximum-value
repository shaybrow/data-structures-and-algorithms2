# Challenge Summary

Create a method that returns the maximum value

## Challenge Description

Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used a recursive, in order traversal of the tree to determine the max value. This should be O(n) for time.
