# Linked List

## Organization

### Linked List Class

- public boolean includes checks for a value

- public String toString prints the LL out as a string

- addNode adds a node at the start of the LL

### Node Class

- constructor takes in a str and a next or just a str

## Challenge Description
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
I used iterative solutions for this problem. This should be log(n)
